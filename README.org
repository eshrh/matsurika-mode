This repository contains tools to make working with [[https://github.com/eshrh/matsurika][matsurika]] easier
in emacs. Matsurika is a fork of janet with some function renamings,
macros and extra utilities to make my life easier while scripting.

There is a matsurika program to generate elisp readable docs which can
then be used by matsurika-mode.el to provide autocompletion via
company and docs look-up of functions (C-c C-d). Matsurika-mode is
derived from [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode/][clojure-mode]] to do a lot of heavy lifting primarily with
indentation. I have always clojure-mode on my emacs anyway, so I don't
care about the dependency. Most of the program is based on [[https://github.com/ALSchwalm/janet-mode][janet-mode]]
by ALSchwalm (GPL). Similarly, this modified version is also licensed
under the GPL.

Originally, these files were contained in the main
repository. However, this makes it difficult to use the mode with
something like straight.el to sync the elisp code across computers.
